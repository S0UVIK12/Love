            <p>Hey, my love,</p>

            <p>You may think I’ve forgotten this day, but how could I? Instead of mere words, I bring you something
                special— a piece of my heart, woven into this little creation.</p>

            <p>You love creativity, and I love creating for you. Our story is unlike any other, a tale only we
                understand. It began with a beautiful friendship— a pretty girl full of life, and a boy hopelessly drawn
                to her light.</p>

            <p>You, with your laughter and fire, always so full of energy. And me, lost in the way you speak, the way
                you smile, the way your expressions change— from that adorable anger to the love in your eyes.</p>

            <p>Every moment, every heartbeat, every dream—I have dedicated to you. Because you are my world, my love, my
                forever. And today, like every day, I want you to know…</p>

            <p><strong>I love you, more than words can ever say.</strong></p>
